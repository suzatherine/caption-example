00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:15.400
Let me introduce you to Kharkiv, my city.

00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:16.933
It's eclectic

00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:21.121
Just like Liverpool, it’s a centre for culture, science,

00:00:21.146 --> 00:00:24.812
education, philosophy and trade.

<<<<<<< HEAD
00:00:24.837 --> 00:00:29.145
The streets are full of students from around the world.

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.401
Situated between Asia and Europe,

00:00:31.426 --> 00:00:34.023
you can see our transnational history

00:00:34.048 --> 00:00:37.501
=======
00:00:24.857 --> 00:00:29.145
The streets are full of students from around the world.

00:00:29.246 --> 00:00:31.401
Situated between Asia and Europe,

00:00:31.468 --> 00:00:34.023
you can see our transnational history

00:00:34.097 --> 00:00:37.501

carved out in the different architecture.

00:00:37.546 --> 00:00:42.367
Here is where the first concrete skyscraper was built in the Soviet Union.

00:00:42.392 --> 00:00:45.723
An amazing monument of constructivism,

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:50.167
made from concrete and iron, using horses.

00:00:50.192 --> 00:00:55.856
Kharkiv is only 40 kilometres from Russia and has become a city on the frontline.

00:00:55.881 --> 00:01:00.123
From the first days, our busy streets, were targeted with rockets

00:01:00.148 --> 00:01:02.501
cluster and air bombs.

00:01:02.568 --> 00:01:06.024
But just like concrete and iron are hard to destroy,

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:08.390
our spirits are also unbreakable.

00:01:08.415 --> 00:01:11.812
As each of us bravely questioned our responsibility.

00:01:11.837 --> 00:01:14.901
Asking how can I help to win?

00:01:14.947 --> 00:01:16.833
To survive?

00:01:16.861 --> 00:01:20.501
And for a moment concerts were silent,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000


00:01:20.526 --> 00:01:23.545
and Philharmonic Music Halls close their doors

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.723
As musicians like Stas Kononov put down their instruments

00:01:27.748 --> 00:01:31.103
<<<<<<< HEAD
and became a frontline volunteer…

00:01:38.756 --> 00:01:41.064
STAS KONONOV: I was meant to play a concert in London

00:01:41.089 --> 00:01:45.289
on the 28th of February.

00:01:45.314 --> 00:01:47.789
On the morning of the 24th

00:01:47.823 --> 00:01:50.990
 a friend of mine, came knocking on my door, shouting

00:01:51.023 --> 00:01:55.156
‘wake up, or you will sleep through the war’.

00:01:55.223 --> 00:01:58.539
For the next few days myself and other artists

00:01:58.564 --> 00:02:01.940
gathered in a small flat near the centre.

00:02:01.965 --> 00:02:04.123
People were coming and going

00:02:04.173 --> 00:02:06.273
 and we were trying to work out,

00:02:06.323 --> 00:02:09.856
should we stay or should we leave?

00:02:09.881 --> 00:02:14.540
I received a phone call from a friend in a more dangerous district,

00:02:14.565 --> 00:02:19.148
saying that there was a basement with 450 people.

00:02:19.173 --> 00:02:21.573
That they didn’t have anything,

00:02:21.623 --> 00:02:24.256
 no food, no water

00:02:24.281 --> 00:02:27.498
and its too dangerous to go outside.

00:02:27.523 --> 00:02:32.423
It was the moment I realised that I must stay.

00:02:32.448 --> 00:02:36.806
That there was a responsibility to provide and seek resources.

00:02:36.831 --> 00:02:39.475
The flat I was in became a headquarters

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.923
and everyone there if not actors, were connected to music, art, culture.

00:02:43.948 --> 00:02:47.323
It was a little chaotic in that moment.

00:02:47.348 --> 00:02:50.323
 Someone provides something and its distributed

00:02:50.348 --> 00:02:52.273
 to whoever most needs…

00:02:52.298 --> 00:02:54.023
Sharing everything…

00:02:54.048 --> 00:02:57.323
It was a very intense process.

00:02:57.348 --> 00:03:00.340
After some time it became more organised

00:03:00.365 --> 00:03:04.045
and we had districts and volunteers in each area.

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.203
Of course it was dangerous.

00:03:06.157 --> 00:03:08.956
Everywhere in Kharkiv was dangerous.

00:03:08.981 --> 00:03:11.490
But I know a lot of examples of bravery

00:03:11.515 --> 00:03:14.940
and for me what I was doing is not brave.

00:03:14.965 --> 00:03:16.940
It was stressful and frightening,

00:03:16.965 --> 00:03:19.656
 it was a lots of things.

00:03:19.681 --> 00:03:22.431
 Everything makes you cry but inside

00:03:22.456 --> 00:03:25.406
but inside you have this feeling that you are in the right place,

00:03:25.431 --> 00:03:29.123
are part of something bigger than yourself,

00:03:29.148 --> 00:03:33.406
that we are all equal, all connected.

00:03:33.431 --> 00:03:38.590
Everyone helps everyone and it doesn’t matter who you were before.

00:03:38.615 --> 00:03:41.806
 You could of been a businessman with a Tesla car

00:03:41.831 --> 00:03:44.990
or an artist who drives something very shitty.

00:03:45.015 --> 00:03:50.440
Even the chief commander of the military base worked without hierarchy.

00:03:50.465 --> 00:03:52.956
 It was a horizontal connection…

00:03:52.981 --> 00:03:54.706
it was solidarity.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.707


00:03:54.731 --> 00:03:57.090
You called someone if you needed something

00:03:57.115 --> 00:03:58.956
and you solved it.

00:03:58.981 --> 00:04:04.123
It felt that one hundred people were one.

00:04:04.148 --> 00:04:07.323
Before the full-scale invasion,

00:04:07.348 --> 00:04:09.873
I was asking these questions

00:04:09.898 --> 00:04:11.590
Who am I?

00:04:11.615 --> 00:04:14.290
 What am I?

00:04:14.348 --> 00:04:19.706
This situation gave me the answers.

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:28.160
It feels like making music has not mattered for a long time.

00:04:28.185 --> 00:04:31.740
A lot of musicians reject music right now.

00:04:31.765 --> 00:04:34.606
To play, you must be in the moment,

00:04:34.631 --> 00:04:37.790
be present, to connect to your emotions.

00:04:37.815 --> 00:04:41.823
It is very stressful and painful and when you start to play,

00:04:41.848 --> 00:04:44.473
you feel your pain and it comes in such a wave that

00:04:44.498 --> 00:04:48.740
you stop and think, never again.

00:04:48.765 --> 00:04:51.990
We don’t have the space to be emotional.

00:04:52.015 --> 00:04:54.956
 So you go round in this circle.

00:04:54.981 --> 00:04:58.956
And come back to the idea that it is not the time…

00:04:58.981 --> 00:05:01.606
maybe later.
