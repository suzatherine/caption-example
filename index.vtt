00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:15.400
Let me introduce you to Kharkiv, my city.

00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:16.933
It's eclectic

00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:21.121
Just like Liverpool, it’s a centre for culture, science,

00:00:21.146 --> 00:00:24.812
education, philosophy and trade.

00:00:24.857 --> 00:00:29.145
The streets are full of students from around the world.

00:00:29.246 --> 00:00:31.401
Situated between Asia and Europe,

00:00:31.468 --> 00:00:34.023
you can see our transnational history

00:00:34.097 --> 00:00:37.501
carved out in the different architecture.

00:00:37.546 --> 00:00:42.367
Here is where the first concrete skyscraper was built in the Soviet Union.

00:00:42.392 --> 00:00:45.723
An amazing monument of constructivism,

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:50.167
made from concrete and iron, using horses.

00:00:50.192 --> 00:00:55.856
Kharkiv is only 40 kilometres from Russia and has become a city on the frontline.

00:00:55.881 --> 00:01:00.123
From the first days, our busy streets, were targeted with rockets

00:01:00.148 --> 00:01:02.501
cluster and air bombs.

00:01:02.568 --> 00:01:06.024
But just like concrete and iron are hard to destroy,

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:08.390
our spirits are also unbreakable.

00:01:08.415 --> 00:01:11.812
As each of us bravely questioned our responsibility.

00:01:11.837 --> 00:01:14.901
Asking how can I help to win?

00:01:14.947 --> 00:01:16.833
To survive?

00:01:16.861 --> 00:01:20.501
And for a moment concerts were silent,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000


00:01:20.526 --> 00:01:23.545
and Philharmonic Music Halls close their doors

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.723
As musicians like Stas Kononov put down their instruments

00:01:27.748 --> 00:01:31.103
and became a frontline volunteer…
